Do you have trouble drinking enough water during the day? Maybe you want a reminder to step away from the computer for a bit. This app will let you set any number of custom reminders that will remind you throughout the day for just that and a whole lot more. If you only want the reminders on week days then select only those days.

Customize each reminder independently with these options

• Notification text

• Notification tone

• Vibrate or not

• Priority

• Start and end times in the day

• How many notifications during the day

• What days of the week to run

• Randomized reminders (or evenly if you want)
